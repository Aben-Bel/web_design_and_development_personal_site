            <h2>Using Relative sizes in web design</h2>

            <section>
                <h4>Units</h4>
                <p>
                    These days web development must cover devices with different screen size. Poeple come to the web
                    to get information on a variety of topics. They want a comfortable site that can serve them content
                    on tablets, phones or desktops. If they find sites unwelcoming, they will not wait another second to
                    try another website that meets their needs. Relative units in web design is a step forward in
                    satisfying
                    user.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In web development, elements and fonts have sizes in pixel. Pixels are collections of grid boxes for
                    a monitor to
                    render content. Each pixel value in the grid have color like an rgb value to display colorful
                    content.
                    This pixel value could be relative or absolute. Absolute values are values that occupy the same
                    amount of pixel size
                    in different computers. While, relative units are, like their name, relative to some value. Meaning,
                    the pixel value
                    of an element or font can differ from computer to computer according to resolution and viewport
                    size.
                    The most common relative units are em, rem, and percent.
                </p>

                <h4>Percent</h4>
                <p>
                    Percent units are still to be calculated pixel values. It is relative to the width of an html
                    element.
                    For example, a p element with 10% width inside a div with width size 500px, will have a width size
                    of
                    50px (calculated from 10% of 500px). In this example, p html tag's width is relative to its parent's
                    width.
                </p>

                <h4>rem and em</h4>
                <p>
                    rem and em like percent are to be calculated pixel values relative to font size of some element. rem
                    is
                    relative to html element's font size. For example, html's default font size is 16px, therefore, 2rem
                    units
                    would mean 2 time 16px units which is 32px. Em unit is relative to its direct parent element's font
                    size.
                    Meaning, a p tag with 2.5em inside a div with font size 20px would have a value of 2.5 times 20px
                    which is 50px.
                </p>

                <h4>Does it matter to use relative sizes</h4>

                <p>
                    Short answer: yes. Using relative units will make user's experience more fulfulling. When users
                    zoom, they
                    increase font-size of the browser's root element, in doing so, increase all element's with rem
                    units. Meaning,
                    visually impaired users, can have a more accessible website. When a user might change their devices
                    orientation,
                    accordingly, users expect content to adjust to the new screen orientation and size changes to make
                    the content more
                    pleasent to consume. For example, when a user switches from portrait view to landscape view, they
                    expect
                    the content to be more spreaded. Responsive wise, websites these days are not only run on desktops
                    but rather on
                    mobile phones. With this, website designers are expected to make mobile device usage as comfortable
                    as desktop usage.
                    Users should not have difficulty interacting with the website.

            <h2>Pixels in browser</h2>

            <section>
                <h4>What are pixels first?</h4>

                <p>
                    Pixels are just squares filled with color in a grid. Every computer got a resolution, how many
                    pixels are piled horizontally and vertically.
                    For example, a computer with 2560x1600 resolution have a 2560 columns with 1600 rows of pixels. Each
                    pixel dimension is eqaul to resolution
                    divided by physical screen size. A 13-inch laptop is 11.3 inches wide, and 6.4 inches long.
                    Therefore, with resolution 2560x1600, a single pixel
                    will have 11.3/2560 (0.004 inches) width with 6.4/1600 (0.004 inches) height. Each pixel has an rgb
                    value. Like wise, a browser will cover less than
                    or equal to computer resolution according to browsers size (expanded and otherwise).
                </p>

                <h4>Understanding pixels in browser</h4>

                <p>
                    Pixels are the same everywhere whether in browser or not. But according to the browsers window size,
                    a browser can cover different pixel value width and
                    height wise. For example, a browser with window size half the monitor size, will have half pixel
                    value compared to monitor pixel value. Like, for a computer
                    with 2560x1600 resolution, a half wide browser window, will cover 1280px (2560/2), essentially
                    making the browsers width 1280px. A 250px wide div tag
                    covers exactly 250px in the browsers viewport. One must be careful, therefore, when using pixel
                    values. Imagine, for instance, you have a 300px wide div.
                    This div element in higher resolution looks smaller in size than lower resolutoin. Because pixel
                    size is equal to physical screen size divided by resolution (screen size/resoultion),
                    the higher the resolution, the smaller the pixel's size. But things are not that simple when it comes 
                    to pixel calculation in browser. Visit <a class="highlight" href="https://johnresig.com/blog/sub-pixel-problems-in-css/">here</a> for 
                    different ways browsers round up calculations.

            <h2>What's new in CSS3?</h2>

            <section>
                <h4>What is CSS3</h4>

                <p>
                    CSS3 is the latest version of Cascading Style Sheets langauge that extended CSS2.1. It is added new
                    features like
                    new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts, transistions or animations, gradients,
                    shadows and more.
                </p>

                <h4>What's new?</h4>
                <h5>CSS3 Selectors</h5>
                <p>
                    In css, selectors are a way to identify an element to style. Almost everything in css is done
                    through selections.
                    Before one makes style changes, one must select an element to style.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Select any element whose attribute starts with some value. For example, <span
                        class="highlight">someElement[attr^=value]</span> will pick
                    'someElement' with 'attr' attribute with value 'someValue'
                </p>
                <p>
                     Select any element whose attribute ends with some value. For example, <span
                        class="highlight">someElement[attr$=value]</span> will pick
                    'someElement' with 'attr' attribute with value 'someValue'

                </p>

                <p> Select any element whose attribute contain some value. For example, <span
                        class="highlight">someElement[attr*=value]</span> will pick
                    'someElement' with 'attr' attribute containing value 'someValue'
                </p>

                <p>
                     More pseudo-classes were added in css3. These are state indicators of an element. The added
                    pseudo-classes are
                    <span class="highlight">root, :last-child, :target, and :not</span>:. <span
                        class="highlight">:root</span> allows to point to the root element of a document.
                    <span class="highlight">:last-child</span> is a
                    complement of the <span class="highlight">:first-child</span>; it selects the last element of a
                    named parent element. <span class="highlight">:target</span>
                    allows designer to draw
                    user's attentoin to currently selected element. <span class="highlight">:not</span> is serves to select element that has not some
                    property applied to it.
                </p>

                <h5>CSS3 Colors</h5>

                <p>CSS3 provides us with other options to set color like RGBA, HSL, HSLA. RGBA is the same as RGB expcept it has additional value, alpha, that sets
                    the opacity level of an element. HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is used to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color. HSLA is similar 
                    with HSL except it has oppacity feature like RGBA. 
                </p>

                <h5>Rounded Corners</h5>

                <p>
                    CSS3 offers a border-radius property that helps you create a curved/round border around an element. 
                </p>

                <h5>Drop Shadows</h5>

                <p>
                    Now, one can add drop shadows to elemetns using box-shadow property. For example, <span class="highlight">box-shadow: 0 0 1px 3px rgb(128, 128, 128); </span>
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Text Shadow
                </h5>

                <p>
                    CSS3 provides a way to apply shadow to individual characters in a text. For example, <span class="highlight"> text-shadow : 1px 1px 0 0 2px green</span>
                </p>

                <h5>Linear Gradients</h5>

                <p>
                    One can create a linear gradient at any angle with multiple colors using <span class="highlight">linear-gradient(direction, color, stop,..., color, stop )</span>. 
                </p>

                <h5>Radical Gradients</h5>

                <p>These are similar to linear gradient with only one difference. The gradient is applied a circlular manner than linear.</p>

                <h5>Multiple Background</h5>

                <p>In CSS3, one can set multiple background either with images or different gradient.  </p>
